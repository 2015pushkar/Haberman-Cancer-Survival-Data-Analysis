#Conclusion
Age and axil_nodes are the most important features.
People died because of cancer tend to have higher axil_nodes and very less chance of survival. For axil_nodes>10 have very very less chance of survival but NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

##Age
The death rate between 48<age<53 is 20% and age>80, the death rate is almost 100%.

The year of operation increased to 100% post 1968 and still the death rate increased to 100% for age>80.

##People having axil nodes around
50% people having axil nodes around 5 have died and around 75% people died for 8<nodes<10

People having axil nodes > 15 has a less chance of survival, but still NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

Mostly they do operations at early stage of cancer itself where Nodes detection value < 10, which increases the chance of survival.
